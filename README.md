# Password-Jester
A password management application.

Password-Jester managers your account information for various different online accounts. You have the ability to store usernames, passwords, pin numbers, email addresses, security questions, and any custom fields that you would like to create. 

Password-Jester is for users who don't trust online password managers. Online password managers store your credentials in the cloud, along with millions of other users' credentials. These cloud storage locations become massive targets for cyber attacks. Password-Jester stores your account information locally, and encrypts the data using your master password. This has a drawback of its own; your password file can be deleted. Fortunately, you can choose where on your PC you store your account information. If you want it to be backed up, you can simply save the account information in your DropBox or GoogleDrive directory, and it should sync automatically.
